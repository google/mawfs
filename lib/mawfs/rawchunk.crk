## Interfaces and tools for dealing with "raw chunks."  Raw chunks are
## just chunks that haven't been unencrypted, and are therefore suitable for
## transmission over untrusted channels and storage in untrusted repositories
## (though additional measures of protection should certainly be imposed to
## protect against inference attacks).
