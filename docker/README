# MAWFS Docker Image

This directory contains files to support building the MAWFS docker image.  The
image is deployed to docker.io/mawfs/basic and can be retrieved from there.

## Running It.

Doing FUSE mounts on docker requires that the container be given special
privileges and also access to the fuse device.

Try running:

    $ docker run --device /dev/fuse -ti --cap-add SYS_ADMIN mawfs/basic

if this doesn't work:

    $ docker run --device /dev/fuse -ti --privileged mawfs/basic

Adding the SYS_ADMIN capability is supposed to work, but for some reason
doesn't always.

Note that these examples use long-lived containers (no --rm option).

Cloning a remote filesystem:
  mfs clone 172.26.108.32:9111:ssl fs2

## Building It.

(Mostly for the dev team, but potentially useful for power users)

Edit the VERSION variable in build-mawfs.sh with the release tag you want to
use.  You'll want to check this in.  And yes, there is probably a better way
to do this.

We follow the convention of tagging the docker
image with a tag corresponding to the git source.  So if the git source is
tagged "rel-0.1", we would use "0.1" as the tag in the example above.

Build from this directory with `docker build -t mawfs/basic:<tag> .`, where
`<tag>` is the release tag.

Push to docker hub like so (you won't be able to do this unless you're
authorized):

```
$ docker push mawfs/basic:<tag>
$ docker tag mawfs/basic:<tag> mawfs/basic:latest
$ docker push mawfs/basic:latest
```
