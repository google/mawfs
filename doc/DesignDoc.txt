Introduction
============

MAWFS is an encrypted, distributed, branching filesystem intended for personal
use, either stand-alone or integrated with other storage systems.

MAWFS represents a filesystem as a set of content-addressable blocks arranged
in a Merkle tree.  The history of the filesystem is stored as a DAG of
"commit" objects, each of which points to the root of the filesystem at a
given point in time.

To obtain reasonable performance, MAWFS supplements the commit history with
journals, which allow changes to be quickly and compactly applied to the
latest commit.  Journals are transient entities, when a commit is generated
(either as a result of explicit user action or due to the journal exceeding
some size threshold) the latest journal is discarded.

Chunks
======

Most of the data in MAWFS is stored in "chunks" (or "blocks" as they are
sometimes called).  A chunk is a an encrypted sequence of data which can be
of any size.  A chunk is indexed by the sha256 hash of its ciphertext,
referred to as the "digest" of the chunk.  In this way, chunks can be stored
and indexed without revealing their contents.

It is important to note that in order for the digest to function as a key for
the chunk, the chunk must be encrypted deterministically: that is, for a
given chunk and encryption key, the encryption function must always produce
the same ciphertext.

Encryption
==========

The encryption algorithm is configurable, in the current implementation uses
AES-SIV mode (RFC5297).  As noted in [Chunks], the encryption algorithm must
be deterministic for chunk indexing to work.

Known Issues
============

Small Objects
'''''''''''''

MAWFS blocks tend to be fairly small.  The Rabin-chunking algorithm used to
break continuous data into chunks chooses a minimal chunk size of 2K (max of
16K), and intermediate nodes (directory nodes, file inner nodes) have no fixed
lower bound.

These small object sizes may be problematic for deterministic encryption.

Possible remediation strategies:

-   Store multiple objects in a block. Reference objects using both a digest
    and an offset, where the digest is that of a larger object that bundles
    together a group of smaller objects.
-   Certain very common objects (i.e. the empty file node and the empty
    directory node) need not be persisted at all. They can be generated in
    memory and cached as soon as the password is obtained.
